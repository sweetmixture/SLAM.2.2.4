geo.txt (regular text)                 - required : Cluster configuration file
sp_cluster_species.txt (regular text)  - required : Including Model Potential Parameters + Optimisation options + logging options
sp_cluster_parameter_src (directory)   - required : s and px py pz radial basisfunction (this version uses FHI-AIMS generated Numerical set)
    In detail, basis functions are generated by clamped-cubic-spline algorithm
        sp_cluster_knot.txt     : including knots (grid-info) // MUST FOLLOW THE NAMING CONVENTION
        sp_cluster_radial_s.txt : including cubic polynomials for 's' function representing intervals
        sp_cluster_radial_p.txt : including cubic polynomials for 'p' function representing intervals

    In 'species' directory - we provide FHI-AIMS tunned basis functions for this code - user can find basis set for 'Bi(III)' 'Pb(II)' 'Sn(II)'
        require appropriate changes, depending on whatever system user wants to simulate.
        (directory must be at the same place with potential file 'sp_cluster_species.txt', and the title must be 'sp_cluster_parameter_src')

# Note that this example is for simulating '(PbF2)5' local minimum structure

Possible execution command
$ mpirun -np 2 ./../slam.240122.mpi.x out.xyz 1000 out.cube > out.txt &
                                      (1)     (2)    (3)         (4) 

(1) - required : standard atomic configuration as 'out.xyx' 
(2) - required : maximum optimisation cycle (if not specified - single point will be carried out)
(3) - optional : generate 'cube' file ... Gaussian Convention used
(4) - optional : logging output


Possible output files,

out.xyz
out.cube
out.txt
geo.txt.next : possible new configuration can be used for further optimisation, if necessary // trim '.next' and run again
